1,1,"Distinguished MTS, Architect",Director,M,4,Exceeds Some,15,Yes,"It had again offered a solid contribution to the team and company over the year.  In the first half, per comments below, we was tasked with leading the Vertical Solutions architecture team and was responsible for architectural solutions spanning many diverse domains.  Of particular impact in this role are the solutions we were able to deliver in the various regions across the world.~~Following on from the first half, it was asked to leave its role in Vertical Solutions and take on lead architect for the Global Credit Expansion initiative.  A new role requiring architectural oversight to the largest program we have committed to to date and possibly the most important initiative we have taken for years past and possibly into the near future.  It has build a small but effective architecture team and has demonstrated an ability to not allow organization boundaries to impede its ability by expanding its capability to matrix leadership of architecture.~~During the time on Global Credit Expansion initiative, the program has turned from lack of architectural definition to clarity and focus on what to deliver, and how that delivery dovetails into overall 001 architecture.  This has resulted in what will be a global credit domain that leverages and complements the many other 001 domains and capabilities.  This is no small accomplishment, it has not been completed, or even attempted, since the acquisition of BML five years ago.~~For its efforts on the Global Credit Expansion program and for the solid work provided in the first half of the year, it has exceeded my expectations and will therefore be receiving an Exceeds Some rating for the year.~~Comments from Mid-Year Review~Its overall contribution remains strong and of a consistently high quality.  It has been leading the architecture team for Vertical Solutions and by nature of the teams charter means that its involvement has had to span many diverse programs, projects, platforms and overall architectural strategies.  It has worked with few resources on its staff, but through network, relationships and organizational influence and has managed to enlist support from many other architecture teams across 001 Technology, including Central Architecture.~~In its charge, from the perspective of architectural oversight, are the follow key initiatives.  Each with carrying the potential of large strategic win for 001…~Marketplaces Portfolio: PROX, Joint Registration, S2F and many other smaller initiatives that are encompassed within the program.~Softbank: Short and long term stabilization.~Regional Solutions: Quick wins across all regions.  Including Australia “TravelDates” and Woolworths engagement, Brazil PPH MVP solution.~India: Architectural support for market entry solutions.~Russia: Architectural support for market entry solutions.~~It has also focused on and led efforts to introduce overall improvements across Customer Engineering.  By introducing and leading the Technical Review Board, it has created a forum which enables greater visibility and collaboration across the many complex initiatives in flight. It also has proven to be a mechanism to bring previously lacking insight to architectural and design decisions that could present issues with domain alignment and interoperability and the potential introduction of large scale technical debt.~~It was deservingly promoted to Distinguished Architect(T29) for its outstanding work last year.  Moving into the Distinguished Architect role has understandably considerably raised the expectations on its performance and organizational influence out"

8,1,Lead Product Manager - Technical,Manager,F,4,Exceeds Some,64,Yes,"H2 I saw it really come into the role of a leader on my staff. It was thrown many challenges new and existing. It had to continue to deliver on the sandbox strategy and start a transition,  it had put in building blocks for simple and single integration strategy . ~~At the end of the H1 2013 feedback was around a few themes to it;~·     Don't let issues linger on for too long~·     continue enhance its skills around telling a story~·     communication more and often~~It took this feedback very well as it took it upon itself to become the advocate at several levels across the organization to really start collecting feedback on product simplification and also tackling issues head on. I saw it communicate more often and the desired outcomes were getting very clear from it.  An area where I saw it further improve was its ability to create a metric and then drive to the desired outcome.~~Below is the feedback from its stakeholders in the organization on things it should be doing..~~Start~1.       Continue working on executive-level communication skills~2.       Execution is excellent, develop some soft skills around collaboration~~Stop~1.         Always assuming that people know the information, please communicate cleary~2.         Do more work in-person or by video~ ~Continue~1.       it has a good understanding of the customer needs. ~2.       Passion that it shows ~3.       it knows how to GSD~~It has really come into its own in H2 2013.

It also has started to take its career more seriously and started to work with its mentors on its area of opportunities. 2014 is a big year ahead for TPM org under it and I like it to really build a solid TPM team and deliver on the work it started around product simplification and payments acceptance. ~Looking forward for it to have a successful 2014."
9,1,"Director, QA 1",Director,F,3,Meets,41,Yes,"2013 Year-End Review was completed by [prior manager], who managed it through November.  [prior manager]'s feeback is below:~~Strengths~It and the Global Ops team had a strong year from a delivery perspective with significant churn happening in other areas of Technology. It was able to keep the GOPS CQ team focused on a high quality bar, exceeding the Agile maturity goals for GOPS and hitting all of the quality targets.  It responds extremely well to feedback, as noted below with respect to improving the Pulse scores for its team.~~Development Areas~We talked during the last annual and midyear cycles about the importance of succession planning:  It does not have a strong successor on its team, and I didn’t see any progress on this front over the year.  I think this is a significant operational risk, but also limits its flexibility to take on other roles.  As it grows in its career, the ability to build strong teams that can self-sustain without it will be increasingly important.~It has made an impressive improvement in Pulse scores, including overall engagement, for its team over the past couple years, and the scores for its overall team are now outstanding.  Looking at the upward feedback from its directs only, though, its manager effectiveness scores are quite low and this area could use more focus.  Two out of three of its directs are not strongly favorable in terms of coaching and guidance, professional development, and clear expectations of their roles.  While the data can be a little skewed due to the small number of direct reports, I think the flip side is that fixing this should not require an inordinate amount of time.  I think this is an area that it can address with just a little bit of focus.~It focused well on GOPS and kept the team on task from a delivery standpoint, but it did not have a strong leadership presence across the rest of the CQES team in 2013.  It’s noticeable, and several of its peers have commented on its absence/remoteness in the past.  Working remotely much of the time, it will require more effort for it to maintain these relationships, but if it can do that there’s a huge additional impact it can make by leveraging it strengths and insights more broadly within the team.~~Summary~It is a strong contributor, and continues to perform very high within the “Meets Expectations” spectrum of our Director population.  From a pure delivery standpoint, it exceeded expectations for 2013.  We would like it to work on continuing to broaden its Technology leadership outside of GOPS CQ.  It needs to develop a strong successor within its team, and with a little focused effort it should be able to bring its Manager Effectiveness scores up to the same high level as the Pulse scores for the rest of its team."
10,1,"Director, Professional Services",Director,M,2,Meets Some,8,Yes,"No written feedback from [prior manager] was provided. ~~As, it new manager I am processing this and have no insight into its 2013 goals. It reports into me now so that's why I am pushing the button here."
11,1,"Manager, Software Development 2",Individual Contributor,M,3,Meets,37,Yes,"It continue to play a critical and leadership role in core Payment Risk team. It worked very closely with BU, product and CQ team in the RPDS migration project, and leaded the team in BU cordination, product requirement and technology design. The project made significant delivery in enable POS judincation on the new technology platform in 2013. It also worked very hard uner extremely aggressive and dynamic timeline with limited resource on the XO replatforming, there were many challenges and issues came up for the program, especially in the second half. it showed strong leadership in the resolution of the issues and worked very hard with the team to achieve the replatforming 30% goal.~~I really enjoyed my time working with it in the last couple years, and with the new role in Payment Risk, I hope it got the opportunity to further showcase its value and strength to the entire organization, especially its deep domain knowledge, business understanding and technical capability. I wish you the best and really appreciate of your support during my time to manage the Payment Risk Domain. "

You have consistently performed very well and shown great execution, technical & leadership skills. ~~You have worked very well within and across teams.  Various team members have given similar feedback.~~Based on the feedback I can think of few areas for you to spend more time on: documentation, and communicating frequently with other team members, to convey status & progress. ~~ "
13,1,"Manager, Business Systems 3",Manager,F,5,Exceeds Most,52,Yes,"Overall, it had a very challenging and strong year.  It brings energy and a positive attitude to everything it does.  It is focused on trying to constantly improve itself and its team.  A very important trait in a leader. Areas where it needs to focus is on seeing the broader picture of the work it and its team do.  All aspects of our work impact other groups and other people.  It is important to understand that we can not be in a vacuum and that in order to drive the organization forward, it is critical we work as partners with other teams.  Both understanding the end goals and their motivations.  This is not a competition, but rather we are all part of the same team.  In this way, I think 2013 was a learning year for it and one in which there were some bumps and bruises as a result. ~ ~This next year is going to be an opportunity for it to take its skills and its team to the next level. The focus will be on truly driving value from the processes implemented versus just adoption. Ensuring we uplift the skill sets both technical and process of its team.  It will play a critical part in making this happen and I am excited for the fresh thinking and energy it will bring to the table."
14,1,Engagement Lead Manager,Individual Contributor,F,5,Exceeds Most,89,No,"Its can-do attitude and professional demeanor is unmatched by its peers.  It continues to work on some of the most challenging projects for 001 and leaves no stone unturned to ensure a successful launch.  In 2013, the team was able to set a launch record for # of Integrations completed, # of mobile opportunities launched, and $ of TPV.  Its project load, in conjunction with a constant thought process of ""how can I do this better"" was instrumental for its success in 2013. ~~Looking ahead to 2014, we're going to see the number of projects explode based on current Sales projections.  I challenge it to continue its personal development path within 001 and to leverage its peers and management to help us all be successful in the coming year. ~~Thank you it for an exceptional 2014.  Final review score:  Exceeds Most"

It, you've done a good job in managing your deliverables while working thru all the changes. You were focused and dedicated to deliver quality products to our customers. You've reported to me over the last 3 months, and I have relied on you to get many tasks completed. Your knowledge of the products, willingness to take the next task even outside of your own scope, helped me to be more productive. Along the way, you educated me about the Quality processes at 001, and how Merchants and Offline quality teams test our products. I counted on you to educate and help to strategize about our next steps in making quality as part of any engineering work. You're open, honest, and someone who debates and willing to change for better. I am thankful for your dedication and level of energy you bring to our management team. ~~Be even more vocal and challenge the current status.

It has the ideas and vision to move the Engagement team forward fast and towards our 3 year strategic vision of being the face of the business, being proactive and helping the business to understand their risk.  It has a clear vision and the appropriate goals and requirements of the team to get where we need to go.  I am very thankful that it joined the team in 2013 and look forward to many more years working with it, watching it grow the Engagement team to world class stature and growing with the rest of the IRM team.  "
18,1,"VP, Professional Services, PayPal",Manager,M,3,Meets,14,Yes,"It had a fantastic year this year as it and its team bent the curve with MTS, improved our technical support, sandbox, integration discipline and experience for customers. It significantly upgraded its leadership bench and brought in needed people for the different areas of its organization. ~~It is driving fundamental improvements to the way the integration teams work globally. Near the end of the year, it was nominated to be the initiative owner for Share of Checkout and Merchant Health.  Additionally, large parts of the integration teams moved to it in recognition for its management strengths and capabilities to manage better.~~However, while the business made progress it did not succeed in hitting its goals. It did very well but as a senior leadership team, we didn't accomplish what we set out to do at the beginning of the year.~~Strengths:~Leadership: it is a natural leader. I appreciate when it raises its opinion and vocalizes a direction. It brings up solid points on how we can all raise our game and hold people accountable to raise the bar.~“It always looks for ways to bring up the energy in the room and breathe life into anything that needs doing. In the spirit of that its enthusiasm breaks down resistance and creates forward momentum.”~“Great partner.  Aligns with me as its xxx partner to drive improvements and provide positive experiences for xxx.”~“It is a charismatic leader, and its team (directs and entire PS group) value its insights and storytelling ability to connect the dots about the work being done in PS and the greater 001 vision.""~~Business Alignment, Partnership and Drive: it does a fantastic job at integrating with the business.

In its current role it very effectively brings all aspects to bear in evolving its own strategy for Professional Services as well as how it prioritizes and delivers services for its clients and partners. “~“It is well attuned to product constraints, revenue challenges, technology implications, merchant readiness, PS support and capability to execute and it can effectively tie all of those pieces very well in how it approaches its work in delivering quality results for its client.”~“It has been instrumental in leading the Merchant Optimization and VOC-M work.

19,1,Software Engineer 3,Individual Contributor,M,3,Meets,71,No,"It is reliable member of AET team. It is the first to start on simulation related work in our team and have been successful in delivering milestones. Encourages effective communication and is a great team player. Its speed and efficiency is an inspirational example to others. It has been greatly collaborating with all members of our team, QA, Architect and consumers to understand “big picture” and deliver “holistic” seamless, distributed solutions.~~While I can entrust it for any critical deliveries, I would like to see it grow its ability to design scalable systems and move up from “execution specialist” to “lead design” specialist."

Please continue the strong drive you have.~~Looking forward to a bright 2014.
21,1,"Program Manager, Online Payments",Individual Contributor,F,3,Meets,66,Yes,"Overall, it had a good year.  It was a key driver in making sure the agile transformation in H1 went successfully.  And it got much more engaged in the operations functions in the second half of the year. One of its strongest qualities is its ability to work and influence across teams.  It is a natural at relationships and has been able to keep many controversial topics in front of the teams without drama or tension.  It is one of the strongest people managers on the Biz Ops team for CSPD.  Areas of opportunity for it are in focusing on being more proactive rather than reactive with requests from [leader] and the CSPD leaders.  Putting in place more standard routines around headcount, financials, communications, scorecarding, pulse and training will be important in 2014 to ensure we can meet the many commitments we have but do so with minimal churn.  Over the course of the 2013, it started putting these in place and there are many opportunities for more rigor in this upcoming year.  Having the vision to anticipate the needs and put in place proactive measures is an area that I would like to see it focus on to grow and push itself this year.~~It is a great asset to the team.  Reliable, dependable, quality delivery and always a positive attitude.  It exemplifies the O23qualities that make a strong people manager and its team's attitudes reflect it."
22,1,"MTS 1, Software Engineer",Individual Contributor,M,2,Meets Some,27,Yes,"In 2013 it worked on various projects starting with being on MAX (Checkout LIVE support team) roster to AS2 Replatforming and later to work on REST API part of Progressive Checkout. It has demonstrated commitments on all of these projects, but the throughput has been at varying levels especially compared to its grade. It has been ramping up on learning Java and good coding patterns especially in the second half of the year. It has a good potential with its smarts and attitude. It needs to make a few corrections in the way it applies itself to be a strong MTS1 engineer in the team.~~3 things to continue doing:~Continue adding value as a ""smart"" engineer with a lot of domain and process knowledge in 001. Its 001 knowledge and its ability to ""find"" things is often useful to the team. ~Continue its commitment to deliver. Its attitude to do anything that team needs to GSD is valuable. ~Continue the process of technical learning and growth that it started last year. ~~3 things to start doing:~As it continues its technical learning, it should start tilting the balance towards applying its learnings. It needs to be the MTS1 engineer in the team who can lead execution and/or design  of small/medium complexity in the team and/or be technical reviewer/mentor in the team and/or lead the way to improve productivity of the team.~It should be more vocal in its communication. Sometimes, it has some good ideas or knowledge that is under-utilized because it doesn't communicate with the team in a confident, clear manner. ~It should get a mentor that can help it through some of these areas of improvements. "
23,1,Data Engineer,Individual Contributor,M,3,Meets,16,Yes,"In 2014, we'll need to find a way to make sure we don't have agents sitting idle because the ETL failed.  Also, we'll plug Saurav into some of the intiatives to better the Data Engineering Practice such as the initiative to make sure we have proper dev/qa environments in place.~~Great job overall.  Keep it up!"
24,1,"Software Engineer 2, Quality",Individual Contributor,M,4,Exceeds Some,85,No,"Good to see the both negative and positive cases are written by doing through analysis.~~Since you are working for Shared team, you should develop your domain knowledge in all Service and rapid flows.~~Contribute for our regression suite, still the pass percentage is very low. ~~Help the regression team to develop a logger to identify the issues earlier. All failed cases should be able to identified easily in 1 hour time.~~Continue to develop the readable and reusable code.~~Our regression suite should be customized to a configurable framework."
25,1,"Director, Mobile Engineering",Director,M,3,Meets,4,Yes,"It is one of the most valuable technologists in the company. ~~Under its leadership, its team delivered  successfully 001 Here Chip&Pin for UK,  and paved the road for a solid foundation for 001 Here SDK.  It also initiated a good structure for 001 Here core services to take off.~~It has eyes for talents.  It built two new strong technical teams in 2013 (001Here SDK team and Reporting  Services team).  SDK team has made a direct contribution to 2013 PPH partner roadmap as well as AU EMV delivery for 2014.  Reporting services team has a great potential to deliver the faster and more reliable reporting services than that of any other 001 existing solutions.~~It is a rare hands-on technologist who gets its hands dirty in the low level implementation as well as high-level planning.  Its work has inspired many engineers and managers.

I look forward to a great 2014 with it."
26,1,"Sr. MTS, Architect",Individual Contributor,M,2,Meets Some,35,Yes,"It implemented some of the key features that integrated with 3rd party services.  MDS integrates with EDL to contextualize the location of the user making the ad request. It quickly ramped up on the technology and enabled the integration. Another integration it enabled was between MDS & Pubmatic, Pubmatic is a source of indirect revenue for MDS. It quickly ramped up on the API and enabled the integration. After MDS went live  we realized that these 2 integrations were contributing to slow response times. It analyzed the problems and created system to either make the calls or efficient or throttled the calls without any impact on revenue.  Over the holiday we did not have any drop in Pubmatic revenue, in fact for some weeks we saw the highest revenue for the year.  It was associated with the MDS project for the whole year, but it only started contributing towards the last few months of the project, and this small time it made a big impact but given its role a lot more was expected from it."
27,1,"Software Engineer 3, Quality",Individual Contributor,M,3,Meets,25,Yes,"2013 has been a solid year for it and it continues to manage and lead the Mobile releases which are increasing in frequency and feature set.~~As Mobile grows in 2014 and we are expected to own 100% of Mobile Commerce in 2014, I expect to see its strong leadership continue and also provide a clear strategy for IQS testing of Mobile in 2014.~~ "
28,1,"MTS 2, Architect",Individual Contributor,M,4,Exceeds Some,32,Yes,"It is the platform software lead for 001 Beacon.  It was initially brought into 001 as a mobile software developer, but it is a highly experienced firmware engineer by background.  When the Beacon project was looking for help, it volunteered to jump in and quickly rose to take responsibility for the embedded platform running on the Beacon device itself.  It has been operating as the Beacon platform architect for about 7 months, and this promotion is really an overdue recognition of its actual duties and responsibilities going forward. ~~In its platform lead role, it has sole architectural leadership over all device-specific software running on the Beacon, including bootloader, drivers, embedded OS, toolchain, and manufacturing software. Its role is highly visible and cross-organizational, and it routinely directs the operation of external partners in addition to the activities of the internal, non-A&I resources assigned to the Beacon platform/firmware team.  It has created processes and tools that have dramatically boosted the productivity of the other engineers involved.  It has done significant work on toolchain and OS build automation with the intent of making it a platform for hardware projects beyond just Beacon.  It is also a major contributor in component selection evaluations, and it suggests both original design and modifications to the hardware design at levels ranging from the system blocks down to individual pin assignments.  It has filed one patent on its work so far.~~Impact to customers, business, and outside of Technology org:~~The Beacon is a key strategic initiative for 001 because of its innovative and transformative impact on consumer purchasing behaviors.  The team working to deliver on the promise of the Beacon is drawn from organizations across 001 and its role is a central and critical one.  Its individual achievements and contributions to the program have been recognized at the highest levels inside of 001, including as witnessed by a Spot Bonus directly from James.~~The initial set of Beacons are about to be distributed to third-party developers and enter into field trials, but there is a lot more work to be done to deliver production units and to transition Beacon into an embedded and widely distributed technology.  It is hard to overstate how important its contributions and leadership will be to making this strategic initiative successful."
29,1,"Director, Technical Systems 1",Director,F,4,Exceeds Some,42,Yes,"It has done an incredible job ramping up on the Professional Services organization, while at the same time delivering on results.   It has been able to provide direction and coaching to its team, and has also been able to focus on getting talent on board, as its bredth of responsibilites have expanded.   Its ability to leverage relationships with Solutions, Product, PD, and Bus Dev have been instrumental to its success.   Going forward it has an opporunity to continue to grow its business acumen and influence skills.   It also has an opportunity to take advantage of interacting with the VP population to further influence that segment of the population."
30,1,"MTS 1, Business Systems Analyst",Individual Contributor,F,3,Meets,58,Yes,"It has been a strong contributor to the GFS team. It has almost been operating as a BSA/PO on this team, due to the limited resources this team has.~~It has been focusing on the SEPA project and has done a great job of working with various cross-functional teams to keep the project on track. It has good attention to details and dedication to ensure its user stories are on target and meet the deadlines set for. Its work on the SEPA project was very well received by the business partners as well.~~It knows its domain well and works hard to develop its knowledge on 001 products overall. It is curious and always asks questions, which is a great quality for an analyst. Its thirst for knowledge has helped it to gain good knowledge of its area and made it the default expert to go to. It has been participative in the BSA practice as well and brings up great questions for discussions. It has made use of various knowledge sharing forums to add to its knowledge and understand new areas.~~As it transitions into a PO role in H1, I would recommend it to focus on getting feedback from its peers and BU stakeholders to understand its brand perception. This will help it in working towards a strong PO who can influence stake holders and be a thought leader with the group."
31,1,Software Engineer 2,Individual Contributor,F,3,Meets,63,Yes,I'm expecting a lot more from it in the future.  Team capacity is getting challenged with multiple tracks popping up.  I believe this will become an opportunity for it to shine.  Snowbird's success can only come with it successfully stepping up and starting to realize its full potential.
32,1,Software Engineer 3,Individual Contributor,F,3,Meets,57,Yes,"It has done very well in 2013. Its transition to the platform team allowed it to gain the confidence and the knowledge needed to become a very valuable member of that team. It does its work well under minimal supervision and guidance. It is very respected by its peers.~~It and I started to work together in October after the Wallet re-org. Its main contributions during the remainder of the year were continuous pricing and the big memory project. The big memory project is its opportunity to lead a complex project end-to-end. I'm looking forward to the completion of that project in 2014.~~Areas of improvements/growth:~- Speak with confidence - its current style is that it speaks about a subject with pretty good authority but then it finishes it with a couple of comments that give the impression that it is not sure of its own accomplishments. It is aware of this feedback, both [colleague] and I have shared that. I will make this a focus area in 2014.~- Expand technical skills~- Expand project complexity - lead more projects"

34,1,"Manager, Data | PMO",Manager,F,4,Exceeds Some,60,Yes,"Overall, for it and the PMO, this was a successful year, as has been outlined above. 2013 was really a foundational year, where the PMO was transformed to be an Agile PMO, with Scum Masters and Agile Program Managers.~ ~Some of the feedback provided by its direct reports that it should continue:~- Providing organizational guidance and background~- Entrust team members to manage their programs/projects including escalations~- Encourages growth, provides platform and provides timely feedback~- ""It is a great manager with outstanding interpersonal skills and grasp of the issues raised by the team. It has actively sought feedback from me on the projects from planning to execution. It has provided me guidance on various parts of my job and responsibilities. It has supported me in completing my commitments to the program and our group. It has a passion to bring out the best in me. It provides me enough freedom to accomplish my goals and tasks.""~- Detail oriented~- Delegates responsibility; does not micromanage~- Supportive~- Dedication and hard work~- Interpersonal skills~ ~Some of the feedback, that it and its management team can work on:~- Promoting and improving the PMO brand inside and outside of DT~- Improving communication~- Consider a ""technology-free"" meeting for 1:1s so that folks feel like undivided attention is being provided~- Try not to get pulled in so many directions as to get out of sync with direct reports~- ""Drive transparency throughout DT""~- ""Program level 1:1s"" with PgMs and SMs to help increase transparency and alignment~- ""It receives feedback about dysfunctions and other issues in the organization but in the few weeks I have been here I have not seen any signs that things will change or feedback about changes being worked on. My impression is that it is reactive to “blow ups” instead of being “open, honest and direct” to deal with the root cause and affect positive change.~- It always stresses delivery. I don’t think it fully understands that the Agile transformation requires more focus on improving collaboration (up, down and across), team morale et cetera and that delivery will naturally improve.~- As a people manager it could provide more support. It listens, says it will take actions and does not always follow through. This example is minor but expenses submitted more than two weeks ago have not been approved yet.""~ ~I am looking forward to the benefits that DT will see in 2014 from the hard work that it and its team did in 2013 to establish the foundation for the PMO!"
35,1,Software Quality Engineer,Individual Contributor,M,3,Meets,77,No,"It was critical in the success of the MDS project in 2013.  Without its efforts, the project would have been in risk of made it's summer deadline to start taking traffic from the PPMN.  Without this switchover, the legacy ads platform would still be running requiring maintenance and support and causing additional migration efforts to move the legacy system to LVS as well.~~In the upcoming year, I will look to more clearly define its role in the Demand Gen organization.  Based on its work with MDS, opportunities are available to it in the devops area throughout the migration to the LVS datacenter.  If these opportunities are not pursued, I will look to get it more involved in one of the local delivery teams as MDS does not appear to be leveraging it to the fullest extent.  ~~In the new year, I will look for it to suggest additional areas where its skills can best be put to work and look for it to research and present new technologies to the group."
36,1,"VP, Technology Business Ops, PayPal",Manager,F,4,Exceeds Some,14,Yes,"2013 was a major year for it. One of its shining accomplishments is where we landed with our Agile transformation. This program started out as a very high-risk program and now, with retrospect, is being recognized as one of our greatest accomplishments. It was foundational to the success of this program. It also went through a lot of change: It adjusted its style based on feedback from the organization and has really made a lot of progress with 001. It did an outstanding job aligning many of 001’s top priorities and technology to make solid progress in 2013.~~It is dedicated and committed to leading 001 forward. It is proactive, strategic and thoughtful on how to tackle problems. I appreciate how it is helping run the organization with me; it knows 001 and it knows where we need to go given where we have been.~~Strengths:~GSD and Transformation: it is extremely action oriented. It knows how to mobilize, how to get things done and how to align a large organization. It did a phenomenal job in orchestrating large-scale change and to set up regular processes and the rhythms so that the way we run the organization becomes part of the fabric of how we work versus being done through heroics.~~Agility& Leadership: It demonstrates and leadership.  It is a quick study and is able to change course when a particular direction isn't working. Because of its confidence and hard-driving nature some people may be put off by its approach initially. I have seen that it is open to feedback and while its demeanor might not appear open, it acts on feedback and improves its performance. As I reviewed its 2012 feedback, I see it made progress in all the feedback areas.  It's been a pleasure watching it develop and grow within 001 and learn how to operate across the this complex organization.~~Communication and alignment: It is world class at driving alignment and communications. It understands how to operate a large organization and how to put the right cadence and measurements in place. It’s also been instrumental in leading CTO staff in the way we work the way we connect with other organizations and in the way we make decisions. It is a natural born leader and I appreciate it steering the Technology ship with me. ~~Development Areas:~Collaboration and ‘Teaming’: It sometimes comes across like it's “it against the rest of the organization”. Or, it might communicate in a way that makes our staff disagreements more visible than they might need to otherwise. Just as it sometimes is concerned with the changes and lack of alignment at ES, it should be conscious that perhaps some things it does cascades and highlights perceived fractures across CTO staff.  It has an opportunity to both directly develop stronger partnerships across CTO staff but facilitate processes and engagement approaches that help us work better as a team.~~Personal Interaction Style: engaging and connecting better: Its speaking style and approach can be off-putting to some people at times. It sometimes communicates in a way that is condescending or belittling to others. It’s done this with people at various levels and it should become more conscious of when it does it.  Sometimes it comes across as arrogance and other times as condescension and it hurts its ability to partner with the very people it is working"

It had zero attrition in 2013, and helped employees with a perceived “lower performance” rating to become highly motivated and delivering great results.~~Leading Platform PMO is not easy, as almost all 001’s teams are dependent on components and/or deliverables from the Platform team. In 2013 these dependencies have become more and more impactful as 001 develops a Platform-first mentality. Because of all this I expect it and its team to play a very active role in setting and driving cross-program dependencies in order to better plan and solve conflicts, delays and impacts way ahead of time allowing all teams to created alternative plans or to change roadmaps.~It successfully drove its team in meeting and exceeding the Agile Transformation goals set for 2013.~~Among the countless products and programs that its help lead is the launch of Uber, PPaaS, Onboarding, Auth, User platforms.~~In 2014 I expect it to be more active and vocal among its PMO peer group across 001 to ensure all dependencies are clear and changes are communicated in time.~~I expect it to play as an equal strategic partner with [colleague A] and [colleague B]. I know it’s hard given both their strong personalities, however they need its skills and direction.

It managed me only thru exceptions and when I requested. It provided me direct and continuous feedback after talking to my stakeholders and supported me 100%.~Ability to manage conflicting stakeholder priorities - it showed good judgement and ability to manage multiple stakeholders with often conflicting priorities. It is not afraid to call out the risks and assign responsibilities. This resulted in several issues getting the highlight they needed.~Decision making - it is fast in decision making and action implementation. I have received quick response from it whenever I needed and suggestions, decisions or guidance~I think it really cares about doing the right thing for people and for the company.

I can also sympathize with what you had to go through because all of the things I have gone through with my mother. ~~Quite frankly, I was on the fence and it was a very difficult decision for me to decide between a ""meets some"" and a ""meets"" rating. I ultimately decided that the ""meets"" rating was appropriate taking everything into consideration and trying to focus on what you could control during this very difficult time personally. ~My goal for you in 2013 was to get back your confidence and show that you could deliver and execute after a tough exit at X.Commerce and an MTS role that I don't feel was successful.

It should work on its volume and presence.  It should speak up and command the attention of the room.~   ~o    Good-Humored and Team Player – it keeps the team laughing with its good spirited jokes and stories.  A room is rarely tense when it’s in it, it keeps the atmosphere positive and focused on the goals at hand.  It’s always willing to take on tasks even outside of its expertise as long as it supports the greater good of the team and company.  "

It need to focus more on influencing its teams and the product owners for the Agile adoption. Also, it need to work towards having a better work like balance."
81,1,"Director, UI Engineering",Director,F,3,Meets,40,Yes,"Strengths~Organizationally strong. It took a decentralized org, created a centralized one and worked out all the bugs over 6 months to get the right leaders in each place. Like a chess board one step at a time.~~Super Positive/Can Do attitude. Consistent feedback is that you never hear it say something cannot be done. It is always ""we will figure out a way"" to make it work. People enjoy working with it even when it provides negative feedback to them.~~Coachable. Seeks to learn from those around it and in its org. I watched it literally pour over the Pulse surveys. Its scores were good. But a slight dip from the past. It met with its people and devised plans and accountability to make itself better. It seeks the same feedback it asks its team to seek as well.~~Execution Strong. Will always deliver. Always get to root of a problem. If there is an issue I don't worry. It is there to drill into it, discuss with me and propose a plan.~~Passion. Solid passion for our teams and our mission.~~Talent Smart. Knows good talent. Knows poor talent. Can hire well. Can attract good talent.~~Development Areas~Get a voice outside of 001 for women in technology. We need more ladies leading the charge. Like to see it really push itself in this area. Help us recruit more women.~~Don't pre-judge. Interestingly, it handles things in a calming manner, but its first reaction sometimes is to assume the person or problem is a little too hard or difficult. What I mean is if it is a person we have history with (being difficult) it will let that previous relationship color its thinking. The good thing is after a little reflection it gets past this. And because it has a great way of engaging it can still usually get past this.~~Leadership Style~Coach. Mentor. Organizationally Savvy. Friendly. Conversational. 1:1 style. Less the stand in front of a large crowd and lead and more of small setting leadership.~~Annual Rating~The ONLY REASON for a MEETS is because it got the promotion in October. By the time of the review it had only been in the role about 3 months. If I was rating it now (This is end of Feb), I would have to give it an Exceeds Some. It knocked it out of the park in the role."

Its ability to work closely and with a fair amount of trust with [colleague] and [colleague] has helped the regions some much needed relief as our core product teams get their act together. ~ Built a good execution muscle, has delivered good results. Strong Agile transformation. It does get into the mechanics and I like when it has strong opinions on what is working well and not in how we do agile. I’d like it to help drive some of this across the CE org as well.~ Seems to want to do the right thing for the organization, seems to have a good handle on its people. It’s trying to strike a good balance between hiring to augment its teams capacity and ability to deliver for the regions and keeping a high bar on acquiring talent. ~~ Other feedback:^v“Focused on execution. Seems to have a good work ethic.”~“Attention to detail, demonstrated in meticulous track record of getting things done on time per ideal process”~“it is a pleasure to work with and is a strong leader who lets its folks lead from the front, but gets involved during key times when needed. It has a great leadership style that is easy to work with, but no nonsense when it needs to get things done. It is driving a lot of change in EMEA with the new local dev team and has pushed forward despite heavy headwinds to do what's right for the team and business. “~“Keenness to help the business find a creative solution.”~“I think it has wonderful organizational vision. When it took over the VS org from [previous person in role], even though it was running quite smoothly, it had ideas on how to extend [previous person in role]’s great structure to take the VS org to even greater heights. It was willing to make the tough decision to shut down a VS team based in Phoenix, and re-constitute it in Austin.”~“it has excellent soft skills. It has a disarming sense of humor, genuinely cares about people, and while it expects a lot from itself and its peers, does not take itself too seriously, which lends to its very likeable charisma.”~“great partner to work with that has no agenda or ego in the way”~“Mature reliable leader.  It plays a key role of managing the 002/001 relationship.  I have seen it to hold a very objective position and be the advocate for 002 where necessary.  Very responsive to any escalation and a very partner to work with.”~“Brand ambassador for technology in the regions.”~~Opps:~Get into the details of the technology choices and architectures more. My sense is right now that it trusts the information that it gets from various individuals and moves on instead of asking “why” a bit more often. Too often when I dig one level deeper there’s nothing there. Some of this is the nature of the significant breadth that it has to deal with partners like 002 that have a vast portfolio. It needs to be seen as more of a technology leader, and the only way to get there is to start having an opinion on directions that teams are taking. That will require some judicious choices but obvious ones like Prox and PUI as well as HSS come to mind. ~ Continue cultivating great tech t"

It has been a strong proponent of foundation work that is going on in Native Apps to create the right level of decoupling in Apps today which is a step in the right direction towards our strategy of multiple apps.~~Login performance ha s been a big pain point of 001 specifically when it comes to Native Apps and it drove the initiative to identify multiple design changes needed in the Auth libraries to bring the login performance to a desirable level.~~With [XXX], it has driven multiple fixes in Apps to get the crashes in apps down by multiple orders of magnitude.~~With it moving to a new Role of driving Technology Innovation within Native Apps I wish it all the best!"

87,1,"MTS 1, Software Engineer",Individual Contributor,M,5,Exceeds Most,17,Yes,"Overall it has been a really great year for it. It has delivered on all fronts significantly and has considerably exceeded expectations. One of the key feedback items for it at the end of 2012 was to show more drive in producing measurable results and utilize its great technical skills for the betterment of the team. It has delivered on both aspects in 2013. It has been very self driven and has stretched itself above and beyond to bring about great changes in the Finprod - Credit team & A/M team. It has taken leadership on several initiatives like RQA, CI, A&M automation, automation code review and has been a change agent. It has earned appreciation from all the folks it has worked with and i look forward to it continuing the same momentum in the upcoming years.~~One area I would like for it to improve on is to be a little more aggressive when trying to co-ordinate others towards a milestone. It needs to identify blockers early on and work with the appropriate folks to get issues resolved. Although Finprod team met its CI commitments I feel that we should have achieved the level 4 certification much sooner. Though not specifically its task, as an overall initiative leader it should drive other team members to adhere to timelines closely and get the task done. This is a learning experience for it and I am sure it has learnt from this experience to apply into its future challenges. ~~Overall, an outstanding year it. Thank you for all that you have done and we will not be in the place we are without your leadership and hard work!. Look forward to your continued success in the years to come."

It is a great leader, able to drive the complex problems that we face as a company.  You can see this as it took ownership of some very complex Globalization initiatives and has delivered guidelines to help us align with similar organization~2. It is subjective.  It is willing to see other sides and engage in conversation over the best path forward.  In other words, it is not stuck on its own opinions or ways.~3. It is passionate about its job.  I have seen many examples where it loves its job, it is truly engaged and as a result, people like to work with it.  It is certainly a great pleasure working with it on [AAAA] Language Support, and I look forward to learning from it in my new role ~- It has high profile visions about how Localization should work.  It's advanced and good vision to take us further down the road to be more efficient and effective organization.~- It has great knowledge and experience in localization process and technology.  From WorldSerer to Adobe CQ, I learned a lot from it in concept level.~- It can talk to other people outside of Globalization to convince them to be on the same page from business point of view (not politics). LQA and IQA separation was a good example. ~~It joined 001 and brought with it its wealth of experience and expertise in Localization/Globalization. It is well-known contributor and respected figure in the Localization industry.

It makes me feel my work is appreciated and it makes a difference to the team. I believe it is a fair and honest person who I can put my trust in. As it is knowledgeable and experienced in Localization/Globalization, I believe I can learn a great deal about these from it.~~It demonstrates all the right leadership behaviors you'd expect to see in an individual in its position.  To be fair, it is relatively new in its role, and it has delivered a wealth of globalization practices (among other duties of course) but in 2014 it is (as many of us are) asked to implement these against an aggressive plan.  I feel that it has the right behaviors to help us succeed as a collective team.~~it is approachable; I have no hesitation in contacting it about any aspect of G11n.    It’s proactive,"

Increase its depth and understanding of how Risk systems work and come up with solutions on how Risk analysis can be made better in the Mobile ecosystem. ~c. Engage with the team and in the existing projects more.~d. Drive towards delivering business results.~~2013 was an year where it joined Risk and proved to be a important engineer that brought in Mobile experience. I encourage it to build up on the momentum and contribute towards some core areas of Risk.
93,1,Program Manager,Individual Contributor,M,3,Meets,20,Yes,"All-and-all 2013 was a good year for it – one that was improved upon in the 2nd half. It successfully navigated a complex/challenging fulfillment space, with the deliveries of both the UK and U.S. Cart to production. I use the word ‘complex’ both from the perspective of organization and management skills needed from a vendor to 001 Core process, as well as some of the challenging personalities involved and ‘political’ nature of the space. It was the ‘glue’ that kept the various teams aligned (i.e. production roll-out coordination, CS Ops, live support, etc.~~There were times earlier in the year where some of the stakeholder feedback was ‘mixed’ (which it and I discussed at the mid-year review). The stakeholder feedback was much more positive in H2, culminating in a spot award for it work on the U.S. Cart release.~I’ve also appreciated its ability to communication to diverse stakeholder groups (going deep with the implementation teams, and then up-leveling for more senior-level communications). I think 2014 will be a pivotal year for it, as I think it is important that it is able to immerse itself in engaging/motivating and ‘visible’ work. My sense on it is it does good work on what is placed in front of it, but from a career development/path perspective needs a program challenge that leverages its skill-sets and that it can really ‘sink its teeth into.’ "
94,1,"Manager, Software Development 2",Manager,F,3,Meets,46,Yes,"This was the first year where it was being evaluated as a manager. It is off to a decent start and if it can improve on the areas called out above, I am confident that it will be able to get recognized as one of the top leaders in 001 Risk. It is receiving an overall rating of Meets for its performance and its contributions are well recognized. It leads many high profile initiatives like 001 Here, Hermes and Global Credit Expansion. These are critical products for the company and I confident that it and team can deliver a strong performance in 2014 and beyond.   "
95,1,"Software Engineer 3, Quality",Individual Contributor,F,5,Exceeds Most,,No,
96,1,Data Engineer,Individual Contributor,F,2,Meets Some,47,Yes,"We had a fruitful year.  As you see, this team sets the standard for others to follow which is something we should all proud of.  Thanks for your achievement in 2013, I'm looking a better year 2014.  I would like to focus on gather more technical expertise on Hadoop and Python.  Please let me know how can I help."
97,1,"Senior Director, Risk and Compliance PD",Director,M,4,Exceeds Some,11,Yes,It had a really stong year.  It has absolutely transformed the compliance team and relationships with an opportunity to strengthen the platform.  It has also delivered numerous projects in Risk that often don't make the headlines but are critical to our day to day business.  It has embraced making our talent stronger through development with the opporunity to inject great talent in its leadership ranks. ~~It is a trusted leader by its business partners and peers.  It has a practical approach to solving problems and and energy and passion to deliver.  I really enjoy working with it and looking forward to seeing it continue to develop and grow.~~Opportunities~1. Bring people along with you.  Take more time to explain why just not what.  Get there input and incorporate into your thinking~2. Strategic Platform - Be seen as the [person] driving the future on the platform.  Balance probably right for this year but should change in 2014~3. Risk/Replatforming - Identify issue earlier and change approach. A number of warning signs here that you could have reacted to earlier.
98,1,Software Engineer 3,Individual Contributor,M,4,Exceeds Some,39,Yes,Over all it is a great technologist. It has to be build the muscle of influence so that its solutions get more attention and adopted. This is very critical for its to move to the next level.
99,1,"Director, Software Development 1",Director,M,3,Meets,5,Yes,"It has been playing the role of leading our Consumer Mobile tech strategy. ~Key highlights:~It reviewed our native app architecture and drove the vision around creating a foundation layer to enable reusability, agility & quality. It is currently a key part of our road-map and in execution mode.~It has been the driving force behind a multiple app strategy. This is now our go forward direction.~It has also contributed in building early prototypes of consumer app for omni-channel usage which has helped drive our merchant sales effort.~It has proven to be an influential technologist & its impact is clearly seen in our road-map & go forward strategy. It has done a fantastic job of building out a network of key leaders across the company to drive thought leadership & strategic alignment in the mobile space. I look forward to its continued impact in the company at a broader scale."
100,1,"Sr. Director, User Interface Engineering",Director,M,5,Exceeds Most,2,Yes,"Strengths:~Continues to be a change agent across technology. Includes all aspects of people, process, and tech spanning many orgs including over into marketplaces. Examples include working with the product organization around Lean UX and CDI, as well as working with every part of PD on how we do adaptive/responsive design including far-flung teams like compliance and risk who want to build up some of their own apps. It’s also been the brainchild behind some of our content re-architecture which will finally allow us a decent localization workflow.~Really does care about what the end product is. It’s not just the mechanics but also what the customer gets out of it. Its years at [prior company] serve it well here as it preaches the philosophy of data and experimentation. It’s starting to take hold here as we finally have the technology to produce what we have been talking about.~ ~Great people manager, enabling its own talent and holding a high bar, while bringing in new talent all at the same time. Has continued to resist the pressure of “just people” instead just doing it with “better people” and better tech. At the same time it’s also our poster child for re-enabling 001s brand as a technology company. It’s out in the field constantly touting how 001 is reinventing itself. It has made a difference and I appreciate it.~ ~Other feedback:~“it has intimate knowledge of how world-class engineering organizations outside of 002 operate. It is also deeply embedded in the external developer community. In my experience working with it, I’ve found that it is one of the few leaders who brings this outside in perspective to approaching problems, programs and organizational change at 001. This perspective is more valuable than ever because of where we are in our transformation, and because it is in short supply.”~ “It is a visionary in its domain. I appreciate our brainstorming sessions and wish we had more. It has done more to attract talented people (through social media, direct networking, etc.) at 001 than most other people. “~ “Culture change agent, fights appropriate battles for the right reasons and is helping raise the bar.”~ “It is a change agent and wants to drive positive change throughout. It is able to create a sense of purpose and is able to bring along a wider set of people toward the new vision.”~ “It exemplifies Charismatic leadership, It creates an excitement and commitment in the organization. It really inspires the team to bring out ideas and move to the next level. I have learned the most about technology, cleaning up my mini bus, Hiring talent and being transparent from it. It inspires me to be better leader and an evangelist for experience engineering.”~ “A great leader to drive innovation. Can make things happen and when it likes something it has this magnetic enthusiasm to excite the team. It is aggressive in moving forward with its team but when opportunity for co-development it is supportive and we have demonstrated with Node.JS and content development a stellar outcome which I appreciate very much and has become GPS corner stone model going forward. “~ ~Opps: Get a bit more into some of the operational details. As we really enable a new set of technologies on the site at scale in 2014, it will have to much more involved in the mechanics of what is breaking and help fix that. To do that it needs to figure out how to get proactive visibility into the flow of the work an"
101,1,"Manager, Software Development 2",Manager,F,2,Meets Some,54,Yes,"It joined the product management organization for Risk/Compliance in late August of this year. The change from the product development organization to product management has been very complex and it has taken some time for it to feel comfortable in its new role. It is now the product owner for the compliance shared team that is developing the compliance onboarding tier 1 service and the general compliance onboarding decision service. These are both critical components for all onboarding, new accounts and new capabilities. The transition to a new domain (compliance), new role (product owner), and a new development methodology (Agile) has been complex and difficult.~~It has used its technical skills to understand the issues and has been able to put together a roadmap plan for 2014. It will need to build new skills in the areas of communication and leadership to make this team productive and build the solid relationships that will be needed to be successful in 2014 and beyond. I have every confidence that it will do an excellent job leading this team in 2014. "
102,1,"Director, Software Development 1",Director,M,4,Exceeds Some,4,Yes,"It is an asset to the company. It is a game changer to get 001 POS to the next level. It is also an amazing person to work with. I am so happy that it is working in my team now. I have so much to learn and partner with it.~~It has a big charter to re-build the org, influence the produce, innovate and deliver for 2014 OmniChannel. ~~I am excited about the opportunity to work with it for this amazing opportunity."
103,1,Manager Facilities,Manager,M,4,Exceeds Some,81,No,"It is an amazing hospitality manager and as such a great asset to the company. It should continue doing what it is doing in this space. However, to get to the next level it has to clearly demonstrate its ability to negotiate better rates for the company and to showcase that it is able to manage a remote team. "
104,1,Software Engineer 2,Individual Contributor,M,5,Exceeds Most,79,No,"It has been a key engineer in the team in making sure that Activity Services went live. It has been one person who has left no stone unturned in getting the release done, spending late nights and weekends. Along with technical contributions, it has also worked on working through the throttle plan, releases during SJC times, working with various folks in SJC for the release.~~It has done a great job in working on various POCs that we did with the team. It has shown great depth in understanding the technologies that it has worked with. For using Golden Gate, it was the one with the deepest knowledge in the team and has come up with solutions when even the DB team had waived their hands.~~It has worked on the finalization of the Data Model. It spent numerous late nights in office to work with the Data Architecture team trying out various options to come up with the final model.~~It worked on the implementation of some components for NAFAS including StoreManager, Activity processor, throttle plan, Query optimization amongst other deliverables.~~It has shown great commitment and drive to learn new technologies. It also doesn’t hesitate in reaching out to folks outside of the team whenever needed.~~Areas of Improvement:~It needs to start working on its design skills. There have been some gaps during the design of Transaction Details service and REST Interface.~~Domain knowledge: It needs to start focusing on the domain knowledge regarding Activities in particular and Payments in general as that would help it in making contributions towards the design decisions."
105,1,"Software Engineer 3, Quality",Individual Contributor,F,3,Meets,61,Yes,"It has played instrumental role in some of the critical projects for Pelican & Honeybadger & ensured the quality bar is high.. Its knowledge & contribution in automation has helped the Pelican team to go from no coverage to 80% functional & 86% unit test coverage in few months. ~~It should continue to work on communication skill, enhance its breadth of domain knowledge and expose it to new technologies, which will help it immensely in its professional growth."
106,1,"Manager, POS Platform Integrations",Individual Contributor,M,4,Exceeds Some,33,Yes,"It stepped up and met several challenges this year, including the successful launch of the 001/Discover integration (13.1) in the spring and the successful second release (13.2) in the fall. This was accomplished with a small team and many hours of high-value interaction with key players at Discover and 001, including frequent collaboration across executive, product, development and BU teams.  In addition to this major project, it invested in developing its managerial and leadership skills and successfully established meaningful relationships with peers and stakeholders across the business which enabled it to influence our strategy and execution of our of In-store product strategy in a meaningful way. ~~ It can continue to grow in its leadership skills by refining its communication style to a more collaborative and value-sharing perspective. At times, its current communication style leads to a more confrontational result, which tends to leave the substance and value of its point of view blurred. It can also develop a tighter approach to work load management by driving frequent, and specific alignment discussions with its leadership and peers on how it will prioritize its work, including what it will deliver and when, and perhaps more importantly, what lesser priority items it will not deliver."
107,1,"Sr. MTS, Architect",Individual Contributor,M,3,Meets,26,Yes,"Since it took over the Risk domain DSA role, it has been instrumental in driving the risk data roadmap forward. Incredible technical talents around data warehousing and data engineering and even stronger work ethics and collaborative approach."

It is always looking at different ways to solve a problem and does not give up easily when it encounters a roadblock.~~It is also a great team player and took the opportunity to mentor on of the data scientists on learning Java. The experience was really positive and it actually mentioned to me it was excited to learn Java because it was such a great mentor.~~It took the ownership of writing most of our graph mining variables. It did a great job working with the other teammates to define the variables, research on possible algorithms and come up with a proper solution.  The team now looks up to it when they have any questions abut our current variable set. Its code is well documented and it has been doing a good job with Java unit testing.~~For H1 2014 I would like to see it getting more familiar with the payments Risk domain’s technical aspects: Which components are live? What do they do? What is the implication of a bad API call? How can we improve ATB? What are the challenges the domain currently faces that could be improved upon? It also needs to get more familiar with the 001 PDLC.~~Mastered ~-       Spends most of the time developing code. Code is well-commented and typically improves after one or more code reviews.~-       Works very effectively as part of the team~~Room for Growth ~-       Has a thorough understanding of technical concepts required for specialized field.~learning to code review related features."
110,1,Technology Fellow - TASA-Architecture,Individual Contributor,M,2,Meets Some,1,Yes,"It had a mixed year. It was doing good job guiding our developers for better engineering and craftsmanship and was a center on knowledge for discussion of difficult problems to solve. On the flip side the expectation of it becoming the thoughts leaders on monitoring that paves our road and techno strategy for world class monitoring has not materialized well for vieaty of reasons and most of them are around how to operate as a influencer when you don't have command and control at play. It was making good attempts to make it work, but could not get it into perfection and the team was having challenges how to work with it while driving internal innovation that built upon it. ~~For next year it needs to figure out what is the best mode of operation for it. I have made a couple of attempts to get it plugged into solution level activities with the business with some resistance from the business leaders (VP M and VP A) to have it assume a leadership position. In the final attempt we see some signs of reception and I hope that it will find a good place to thrive. Apparently platform work that is business agnostics is not the most successful place for it to operate. "
